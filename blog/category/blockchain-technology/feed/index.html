				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchains have been ruling the technological world for a while now. With companies investing lump sum in opportunities to secure data, blockchain technology is here to change the ideology of Cybersecurity. Cybersecurity has been an avenue of concern for ages. With the advent of blockchain technology, businesses can breathe a sigh of relief. Some of the advances that this technology can bring are mind-boggling. </span></p>
<p><b>Digital Authentication:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humans will no longer be needed to authenticate information. With blockchain technology, businesses will be able to authenticate users and devices. The problem arises when companies allow employees or customers to set their own passwords that becomes an encouraging component for theft. Blockchain technology resolves single point of attack and offers strong authentication.</span></p>
<p><b>Uncollapsible chain :</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blockchain is a huge network that stores data and is extremely secure. Since data is stored in blocks it is highly impossible to tamper with it since the blocks recognise attacks and eliminate the affected block deeming it unrecognisable.  </span></p>
<p><b>Transparency and Traceability:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of technology has a different approach toward traceability. It is no doubt that the transactions are accessible to the entire world yet every transaction is traceable. Irrespective of its gigantic network system, with the blockchain technology one can trace back to any transaction for any period of time. </span></p>
<p><b>Prevents Data Manipulation:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any digital data can be breached to create a different result which might end up being harmful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain Technology prevents data manipulation with its high-end cryptographic data structures. </span></p>
<p><b>No trust issues:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain technology uses cryptographic language and security is not dependent on passwords. Since it avoids human activity to authenticate, there are no passwords to be trusted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the safest and secure mode of storage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these exclusive <a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blockchain-development-company">features of blockchain technology</a> comes to the good news &#8211; Since blockchain technology uses encryption methods it is believed that it might take seven billion years for a hacker to get into the network using a brute-force attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has been a boon to many individuals and businesses alike. Blockchain technology has created trust and fulfilment in the hearts of millions. No matter what the future holds, Blockchains are here to stay. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blockchain technology is the decentralized or distributed ledger technology used mainly to trade without any loses or the middlemen. The blockchain technology in the financial sector uses cryptocurrencies in order to perform a glitch-free transaction across channels and with any number of traders. There are many different cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Bitcoin, Ripple et cetera that traders use and there are 700 more virtual currencies being traded around the world currently. As per actual practice, the following industries can employ blockchain technology to make the most out of this cryptocurrency surge. </span></p>
<p><b>Banking Sector</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the use of blockchain technology in the banking and payment sector, billions of people can get easy access to the financial opportunities. Even those who don’t currently have access to the traditional payment options can utilize blockchain technology to trade. Across seas and nations, blockchain technology will help traders make business at extremely very low fees. Since the transactional data backed up with blockchain technology is highly encrypted and tough to track, this is one such secure way to trading. </span></p>
<p><b>Supply Chain Management</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transactions using blockchain technology can be entered as a non-removable/permanent decentralized record. Can be monitored securely and transparently. This can keep us off time lag and human errors. Predominantly used to observe costs, labour, and waste management and emissions at every step of the <a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/supply-chain-management-development">supply chain</a>. This will greatly help to understand and control the actual environmental impact caused by the products. Can also be used to verify the originality of products by tracking them from the inception day. </span></p>
<p><b>Storage on Cloud</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data stored on a centralized server is naturally prone to hacking, loss of data or human error and interventions. Blockchain technology will allow cloud storage to be more secure and essentially fight against data breaches. </span></p>
<p><b>Charity</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inefficiency and corruption are the common complaints within the charity space. Which basically prevents money from getting to the appropriate person. Using blockchain technology will help us track whether or not the donations are going to the right individual/association. Bitcoin-based charities like the BitGive Foundation uses blockchain’s secure and decentralized ledger providing donors with the information that the intended party has received the funds.</span></p>
<p><b>Election</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most important areas of society that the blockchain will do actual good to is electoral reforms. The recent past 2016 US election is not the only time parties were cited for controversial election results. <a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blockchain-development-company">Blockchain technology</a> can be used in future for voter registration and identity verification. Also for electronic vote counting to assure that only valid votes are tallied. Creating a publicly-viewable ledger of legitimately obtained votes would be a huge step toward making elections more democratic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further if you have any other verticals that you think blockchain technology can disrupt or leave a mark, mention them in the comment.
