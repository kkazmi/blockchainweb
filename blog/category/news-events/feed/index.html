				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The technology of today’s world is progressing at a very frantic pace. New innovations and technological developments have made it possible to develop new synergies in an existing framework. Blockchain technology which has bamboozled peopled across with its effectiveness made it possible to dream about a decentralized unit. Similarly, Internet of Things (IoT) has also been picking up a rapid pace. With the help of IoT, independent devices will be able to connect themselves to the internet. This synchronization will help in the development of intelligent devices which will be able to carry out work independent of human interference. But what happens if IoT is integrated with Blockchain? It does sound straight out of a science fiction novel. However, IoT and Blockchain seem to be a natural fit. In this article, we will discuss how IoT will influence the future of Blockchain technology and why nobody has yet succeeded at running IoT on the blockchain framework. </span></p>
<h4><b>IoT- A significant jump towards the future</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IoT is based on the concept where wirelessly connected sensors are embedded in almost any commonly used devices such as refrigerators, auto-parts, washing machines and even dog collars. This means everything can be tracked, it’s inventory managed and can be made accessible through a continuous stream of signals. This constant flow of interacting devices will help the businesses to move away from the product-oriented theme to the service-oriented theme. But it also brings us to one important issue to address. According to estimates, there will be around 10 million inter-connected devices and objects in the next four years. This will create a huge amount of tracking to identify those things and also verify who owns them, authenticate their interaction with other things in the interloop. </span></p>
<h4><b>How will IoT influence the landscape of Blockchain technology in the future?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many reputed organizations such as IBM have already started testing and experimenting with the applicability and future potential uses for the <a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blockchain-iot-development">blockchain network and the Internet of Things (IoT)</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For integrating the blockchain network with the IoT, developers must ensure that they treat every individual device as a unique user of the blockchain. Therefore, every vital piece of information that gets transmitted from the IoT device is processed by the Blockchain network as a transaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory this system does sound feasible, however, this is only possible if the size and the transmission of the messages are limited. Commercial deployment of blockchain based businesses will take some time as the blockchain based IoT network has to be upgraded significantly in order to serve many users.</span></p>
<h4><b>Why is it still a longshot solution?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the main problems blockchain network is facing these days is the scalability factor. To increase the scalability, optimizing the chain will help a bit but for mainstream market applications one must boost up the transaction processing speed which will affect other applications connected to the chain as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At present, only the Ethereum network, has more flexibility than other networks such as bitcoin, which can process only six transactions per second. To make a jump from six transactions per second to hundreds of thousands of transactions per second is definitely unrealistic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to handle this, an unprecedented scalability solution must be implemented. Plasma, an Ethereum scaling solution, could become a practical solution to the severe scalability issues of blockchain networks. It uses multiple blockchain networks that are interconnected with each other, and several aspects of transactions are kept confidential through the usage of ZK-SNARKs cryptographic system. This reduces the size of transactions and ultimately, increases the capacity of the blockchain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> However, even with side chains and second-layer solutions like Plasma or Lightning Network, it is still out of the question for a blockchain to handle hundreds of thousands of data points per second. IBM  is currently focused on developing centralized blockchain networks. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the implementation of permission blockchain networks, there is a definite trade-off between security and flexibility. Nevertheless, this will assist in the successful implementation of blockchain technology with IoT in the near future.</span></p>
<h4><b>Conclusion</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, permission blockchain networks are the only realistic solution in terms of scalability and there are a few organizations which specialize in designing permissioned Blockchain networks. Blockchain App factory is one of the few reputed organizations apart from IBM which has successfully created permission private blockchain networks for numerous clients. The conglomeration of IoT and Blockchain can do wonders for the business.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past few months, we have been hearing the words Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin Wallets, Cryptocurrency Wallets etc. In this blog, we would like to give you an overview of the Cryptocurrency Wallets Development.</span></p>
<p><b>What is Cryptocurrency Wallet Development?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cryptocurrency wallet is a secure digital wallet used to store, send and receive digital cryptocurrencies like BitCoins, ERC20 etc. These cryptocurrencies have their own wallets, however, some companies use a third party wallet. In order to use cryptocurrency, you need to have <a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/cryptocurrency-wallet-development">developed new cryptocurrency wallet</a>.</span></p>
<p><b>How does Cryptocurrency Wallet Work?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cryptocurrency is not stored in wallet per say. Instead, it is a private key which is secure digital code that is only known to you. In addition to this, there is a public digital code which is connected to a certain amount of currency. The crypto-wallet stores this public as well as private key allowing the user to send and receive coins with the addition of acting as a ledger for the money sent and received.</span></p>
<p><b>Which is the best Cryptocurrency Wallet?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cryptocurrency wallets depend on the coin you are going to use. We at Blockchain App Factory suggest you use the official/officially endorsed wallet of the given coin. For example, use the Bitcoin Core Wallet for the Bitcoin, Litecoin Core for Litecoin and MyEtherWallet for Ethereum Coins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are wallets like HolyTransaction and Coinomi which can be used universal or multi-coin wallets which can store many cryptocurrencies, however, they cannot store all the currencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some custodial wallets where the private keys are not controlled by the user, however, users are advised against keeping their funds in exchanges which act as double to custodial wallets. There are useful offline hardware wallets like TREZOR and Nano S which are good long-term wallets allowing you to store various cryptocurrencies.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, March 8 has been recognized as International Women’s Day. On this day, women around the world irrespective of nationality, ethnicity or cultural differences come around to support each other and take care of their peers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women have changed the face of the workforce and entered in every aspect of the field. We, at Blockchain App Factory, have celebrated International Women’s Day with much pomp and joy. All the women came around to enjoy this day to the full extent. </span></p>
<p><b>Events in place</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To enjoy this joyous day, our women from Blockchain App Factory came around to enjoy various events set by our Human Resource team. Team events made sure that everyone participated and get to know each other’s strength and weaknesses. Every woman at our Blockchain App Factory had the best of time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An event named PASS OF GEMS were played to test out the how two women from the completely different team were able to play a game. The objective of the game is to pass on gems from one bottle into next without taking out the top one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So with constant teamwork and extreme fun of passing the gems although messing up a few in the process, our women were able to send it down to next bottle for 3 minutes without hassles. </span></p>
<p><b>Finally…</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And a plethora of events made this international women’s day an occasion to remember. Women’s day is not about enjoying the power of womanhood but taking a knee in the ground and holding our sisters and peers around us and getting out of the shackles and boundaries that have set us back. Take your feminism and work hard for equality in every facet of work and life. Womanhood is to be celebrated and to be proud of our fight in this world. This women’s day at Blockchain App Factory has honored our Women and made us happy for all the days to come.</span></p>
