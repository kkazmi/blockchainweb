				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The technology of today’s world is progressing at a very frantic pace. New innovations and technological developments have made it possible to develop new synergies in an existing framework. Blockchain technology which has bamboozled peopled across with its effectiveness made it possible to dream about a decentralized unit. Similarly, Internet of Things (IoT) has also been picking up a rapid pace. With the help of IoT, independent devices will be able to connect themselves to the internet. This synchronization will help in the development of intelligent devices which will be able to carry out work independent of human interference. But what happens if IoT is integrated with Blockchain? It does sound straight out of a science fiction novel. However, IoT and Blockchain seem to be a natural fit. In this article, we will discuss how IoT will influence the future of Blockchain technology and why nobody has yet succeeded at running IoT on the blockchain framework. </span></p>
<h4><b>IoT- A significant jump towards the future</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IoT is based on the concept where wirelessly connected sensors are embedded in almost any commonly used devices such as refrigerators, auto-parts, washing machines and even dog collars. This means everything can be tracked, it’s inventory managed and can be made accessible through a continuous stream of signals. This constant flow of interacting devices will help the businesses to move away from the product-oriented theme to the service-oriented theme. But it also brings us to one important issue to address. According to estimates, there will be around 10 million inter-connected devices and objects in the next four years. This will create a huge amount of tracking to identify those things and also verify who owns them, authenticate their interaction with other things in the interloop. </span></p>
<h4><b>How will IoT influence the landscape of Blockchain technology in the future?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many reputed organizations such as IBM have already started testing and experimenting with the applicability and future potential uses for the <a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blockchain-iot-development">blockchain network and the Internet of Things (IoT)</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For integrating the blockchain network with the IoT, developers must ensure that they treat every individual device as a unique user of the blockchain. Therefore, every vital piece of information that gets transmitted from the IoT device is processed by the Blockchain network as a transaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory this system does sound feasible, however, this is only possible if the size and the transmission of the messages are limited. Commercial deployment of blockchain based businesses will take some time as the blockchain based IoT network has to be upgraded significantly in order to serve many users.</span></p>
<h4><b>Why is it still a longshot solution?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the main problems blockchain network is facing these days is the scalability factor. To increase the scalability, optimizing the chain will help a bit but for mainstream market applications one must boost up the transaction processing speed which will affect other applications connected to the chain as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At present, only the Ethereum network, has more flexibility than other networks such as bitcoin, which can process only six transactions per second. To make a jump from six transactions per second to hundreds of thousands of transactions per second is definitely unrealistic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to handle this, an unprecedented scalability solution must be implemented. Plasma, an Ethereum scaling solution, could become a practical solution to the severe scalability issues of blockchain networks. It uses multiple blockchain networks that are interconnected with each other, and several aspects of transactions are kept confidential through the usage of ZK-SNARKs cryptographic system. This reduces the size of transactions and ultimately, increases the capacity of the blockchain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> However, even with side chains and second-layer solutions like Plasma or Lightning Network, it is still out of the question for a blockchain to handle hundreds of thousands of data points per second. IBM  is currently focused on developing centralized blockchain networks. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the implementation of permission blockchain networks, there is a definite trade-off between security and flexibility. Nevertheless, this will assist in the successful implementation of blockchain technology with IoT in the near future.</span></p>
<h4><b>Conclusion</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, permission blockchain networks are the only realistic solution in terms of scalability and there are a few organizations which specialize in designing permissioned Blockchain networks. Blockchain App factory is one of the few reputed organizations apart from IBM which has successfully created permission private blockchain networks for numerous clients. The conglomeration of IoT and Blockchain can do wonders for the business.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchains have been ruling the technological world for a while now. With companies investing lump sum in opportunities to secure data, blockchain technology is here to change the ideology of Cybersecurity. Cybersecurity has been an avenue of concern for ages. With the advent of blockchain technology, businesses can breathe a sigh of relief. Some of the advances that this technology can bring are mind-boggling. </span></p>
<p><b>Digital Authentication:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humans will no longer be needed to authenticate information. With blockchain technology, businesses will be able to authenticate users and devices. The problem arises when companies allow employees or customers to set their own passwords that becomes an encouraging component for theft. Blockchain technology resolves single point of attack and offers strong authentication.</span></p>
<p><b>Uncollapsible chain :</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blockchain is a huge network that stores data and is extremely secure. Since data is stored in blocks it is highly impossible to tamper with it since the blocks recognise attacks and eliminate the affected block deeming it unrecognisable.  </span></p>
<p><b>Transparency and Traceability:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of technology has a different approach toward traceability. It is no doubt that the transactions are accessible to the entire world yet every transaction is traceable. Irrespective of its gigantic network system, with the blockchain technology one can trace back to any transaction for any period of time. </span></p>
<p><b>Prevents Data Manipulation:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any digital data can be breached to create a different result which might end up being harmful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain Technology prevents data manipulation with its high-end cryptographic data structures. </span></p>
<p><b>No trust issues:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain technology uses cryptographic language and security is not dependent on passwords. Since it avoids human activity to authenticate, there are no passwords to be trusted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the safest and secure mode of storage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these exclusive <a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blockchain-development-company">features of blockchain technology</a> comes to the good news &#8211; Since blockchain technology uses encryption methods it is believed that it might take seven billion years for a hacker to get into the network using a brute-force attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has been a boon to many individuals and businesses alike. Blockchain technology has created trust and fulfilment in the hearts of millions. No matter what the future holds, Blockchains are here to stay. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blockchain is a robust technology which bears resemblance to the internet of the 90s era, however, it is designed to impact the way we live, we function and the way we interact. Originally created for the regulation of digital currency such as Bitcoin, it is basically a digital, decentralized public ledger for all the cryptocurrencies. One of the unique aspects of Blockchain technology is that digital information can be distributed not copied, creating a backbone for a new type of internet. Presently, this technology is being primarily used to verify transactions, within the digital currencies; nevertheless, the tech community is finding other potential uses for the technology. </span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blockchain-development-company"><b>How will Blockchain technology impact other industries?</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The popularity of virtual currencies is proving Blockchain’s usefulness in finance, but industry experts believe that blockchain can transform more industries. Since blockchain operates through a decentralized platform which requires no supervision, it is extremely resistant to fraud. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly a lot of start-ups are deploying Blockchain in an effort to strive for greater transparency and accuracy across the <strong>digital information ecosystem</strong>. By switching to the blockchain, they are boosting awareness in other sectors ranging from infrastructure to public policy. Following are the different industrial segments which are harnessing the power of global blockchain:-</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><b>Banking Sector</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since blockchain uses a secure and tamper-proof ledger, it could serve the same function by injecting enhanced accuracy and information sharing into the financial services ecosystem. It can be modified to provide financial services to billions of people around the world, including to those who are living in third world countries who don’t have any access to a traditional form of banking. The UK based Barclays and Swiss bank UBS have already started experimenting with blockchain technology to accelerate the back office tasks, which could cut up to $20 billion in middleman costs. Banks are currently exploring and investing in <strong>Blockchain start-ups such as R3 CEV, who are currently working along with banks, financial regulators and technological partners in developing Corda,</strong> an exclusive blockchain platform designed specifically for the new operating system for financial markets.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><b>Real Estate</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often the real estate segment gets a bad rep due to the lack of transparency during and after the transactions, large amounts of paperwork, fraud and unwarranted human errors in public records as well. But Blockchain offers a distinct method to <strong>reduce the need for paper-based record keeping and speed up the transactions,</strong> thus assisting the stakeholders to improve the efficiency and help in reduction of transaction costs at all sides of the transaction. <a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blockchain-development-company">Real estate Blockchain applications</a> can help in recording, tracking, transferring of land titles, property deeds and even ensure that all the documents are accurate and verifiable. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blockchain-development-company"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137" src="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Real-estate.jpg" alt="Industries that benefit from Blockchain technology Real estate " width="870" height="415" srcset="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Real-estate.jpg 870w, https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Real-estate-300x143.jpg 300w, https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Real-estate-768x366.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><b>Supply chain and Logistics</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using this technology financial transaction can be well-documented in a decentralized record and monitored separately. One of the advantages of using Blockchain is that it provides secure remote and transparent monitoring of transactions. This will <strong>reduce the potential time delays and removes human errors</strong>. Aside from that, it can also be used to monitor costs, labour and even emission control at every point of the supply chain. Blockchain’s unique<strong> distributed ledger system</strong> can be used to verify the authenticity or the trade status of products by thoroughly tracking them from their origin. Provenance, Hijro, SKUChain and Blockverify are some of the reputed blockchain companies currently working in this segment.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blockchain-development-company"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-138" src="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Logistics.jpg" alt="" width="920" height="500" srcset="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Logistics.jpg 920w, https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Logistics-300x163.jpg 300w, https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Logistics-768x417.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 920px) 100vw, 920px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><b>Education segment</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are all aware of the strict regulations that the present day <strong>educational institutions follow in order to be universally accepted and verified.</strong> Despite the progress made in recent year’s verification of academic credentials still remains largely a manual process. Instilling blockchain solutions in the academic process could help in streamlining the verification process, thereby reducing fraudulent claims of un-earned educational credits. Recently Sony Global Education has developed a new educational platform in an exclusive partnership with IBM that uses <strong>Blockchain to secure the student records.</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blockchain-development-company"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-139" src="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Education.jpg" alt="Industries that benefit from Blockchain technology Education" width="980" height="551" srcset="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Education.jpg 980w, https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Education-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Education-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></a></p>
<h2><b>Future application in different segments</b></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><b>Healthcare Segment</b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthcare institutions are presently suffering from an inability to share data securely across platforms.
