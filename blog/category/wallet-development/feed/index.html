				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past few months, we have been hearing the words Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin Wallets, Cryptocurrency Wallets etc. In this blog, we would like to give you an overview of the Cryptocurrency Wallets Development.</span></p>
<p><b>What is Cryptocurrency Wallet Development?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cryptocurrency wallet is a secure digital wallet used to store, send and receive digital cryptocurrencies like BitCoins, ERC20 etc. These cryptocurrencies have their own wallets, however, some companies use a third party wallet. In order to use cryptocurrency, you need to have <a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/cryptocurrency-wallet-development">developed new cryptocurrency wallet</a>.</span></p>
<p><b>How does Cryptocurrency Wallet Work?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cryptocurrency is not stored in wallet per say. Instead, it is a private key which is secure digital code that is only known to you. In addition to this, there is a public digital code which is connected to a certain amount of currency. The crypto-wallet stores this public as well as private key allowing the user to send and receive coins with the addition of acting as a ledger for the money sent and received.</span></p>
<p><b>Which is the best Cryptocurrency Wallet?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cryptocurrency wallets depend on the coin you are going to use. We at Blockchain App Factory suggest you use the official/officially endorsed wallet of the given coin. For example, use the Bitcoin Core Wallet for the Bitcoin, Litecoin Core for Litecoin and MyEtherWallet for Ethereum Coins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are wallets like HolyTransaction and Coinomi which can be used universal or multi-coin wallets which can store many cryptocurrencies, however, they cannot store all the currencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some custodial wallets where the private keys are not controlled by the user, however, users are advised against keeping their funds in exchanges which act as double to custodial wallets. There are useful offline hardware wallets like TREZOR and Nano S which are good long-term wallets allowing you to store various cryptocurrencies.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>What is a Cryptocurrency Wallet?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Cryptocurrency wallet is a highly secured digital which is used to receive, send, and store private keys that claim ownership of public keys associated with a certain amount of Cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. The wallet also acts as a personal ledger of all transactions carried out through it. There are many types of Cryptocurrency wallets available on the market today. Popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum offer officially endorsed secure wallets. Universal wallets and offline wallets for long storage are also available options but one can never be wary enough of malware disguised as wallet software.</span></p>
<p><b>How secure are Cryptocurrency wallets?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Cryptocurrency wallets are designed to be secure but the security levels of Cryptocurrency wallets differ from wallet to wallet. It is advisable to not store more currency than you require at a time in a frequently used wallet. Not sharing your private keys and passwords and using Google authenticator and multi-signature transactions also add to the security of your wallet. It is wise to have an encrypted hard copy backup of your wallet and private keys to ensure that you do not lose them. Losing private keys means losing the cryptocurrency associated with it and there is no way of retrieving lost private keys unless you have a backup.</span></p>
<p><b>Are Cryptocurrency wallets anonymous?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cryptocurrencies are pseudonymous. Users are identified with their public keys which do not require them to reveal any personal information. The open source and public nature of Blockchain ledgers allow little to no scope of tracking the identity of a user. These features make cryptocurrency wallets anonymous to a large extent.</span></p>
<p><b>What are the types of Cryptocurrency Wallets?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on the medium on which the wallet is stored and its offline or online availability, the different types of Cryptocurrency wallets available are Online, hardware, desktop, mobile, and paper. Some wallets, like the Bitcoin wallet, offer multiple methods of access such as desktop and mobile. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is an overview of different types of cryptocurrency wallets:</span></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-59 alignright" src="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/bitcoin-paper-coin-and-USB-wallets-blockchainappfactory-300x200.jpg" alt="bitcoin-paper-coin-and-USB-wallets-blockchainappfactory" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/bitcoin-paper-coin-and-USB-wallets-blockchainappfactory-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/bitcoin-paper-coin-and-USB-wallets-blockchainappfactory-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/bitcoin-paper-coin-and-USB-wallets-blockchainappfactory.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><b>Online Wallets</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Also known as âhot walletsâ, online wallets are web-based wallets that host data on a real or virtual server. Some hybrid online wallets allow encryption of private data before forwarding to the online server.</span></p>
<p><b>Offline/Hardware Wallets</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Hardware wallets include USB devices or specific hardware created to securely hold cryptocurrency. The wallets can go online for data and transactions but are taken offline for transportation or security.</span></p>
<p><b>Desktop Wallet</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: This is the most common type of wallet available and connects directly to the coin holder.</span></p>
<p><b>Mobile Wallet</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: These types of wallets are run and can be accessed from a smartphone.</span></p>
<p><b>Paper Wallet</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Paper wallets completely avoid digital interaction by printing out the QR codes for private and public keys. These types of wallets are considered highly secure although they limit fluidity.</span></p>
<p><b>Desired Traits in Cryptocurrency Wallets</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all cryptocurrency wallets are made the same way. Some offer more security while others offer unparalleled convenience. Here are some traits to look out for, before choosing your wallet.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â </span><b>Cost </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">â Some wallets are available for free. It is important to consider all factors with such wallets.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â </span><b>Security</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> â The security record of the company and its products may help you analyze the security of specific cryptocurrency wallets.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â </span><b>Mobility</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> â The ease of storage, accessibility and the risk of losing your keys must be considered.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Â Â Â </span><b>Convenience</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> â The transaction time, the range of supported altcoins and the UI can be analyzed to filter out a wallet that offers convenience.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever be the type of wallet, it pays to follow security practices like not sharing your private keys and keeping a backup of your keys. Cryptocurrency wallets are safe and secure storage and exchange platforms for altcoins if utilized properly. You can also <a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/cryptocurrency-wallet-development">build your own cryptocurrency wallets</a> with custom integrations, keeping in mind the above-mentioned factors.
