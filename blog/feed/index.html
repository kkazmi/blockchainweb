				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the recent years, cryptocurrency drastic rise in value has stoked a large amount of public interest in virtual coins and altcoins which are constantly being created every day. Currently, there are many virtual currencies in existence and that’s mainly due to the presence of dedicated virtual currency creation services present in the market. The likes of coin creator, wallet builder, and CryptoLife assists us in carrying out the technical work unless the coin creator does not have a clear set of interest and commitment, the customer is bound to fail in this task eventually. So, if you are planning to create your own cryptocurrency, you should be wise enough to follow these steps.</span></p>
<p><b>Creation of a New Blockchain network</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first and foremost step is the creation of a blockchain network. Most of the modern cryptocurrencies function within a blockchain framework. This is a completely decentralized network which highlights the importance of cryptocurrencies. Creating a blockchain framework will also give complete control over the coin code. Through the blockchain system, you will be able to create your own altcoin right from the beginning allowing you to incorporate new, ingenious features of your very own cryptocurrency.  The benefits of using this method are: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will have a number of options available for customizing your own coin to make it stand out.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be able to choose the number of miners or minters based on the earnings according to proof of work/proof of stake rewards.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional options such as choice of the block size, maximum coin supply and the rate of issuing new coins will always be under your control.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Crafting a crypto-coin fork</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are certain drawbacks to having control over everything. But creating a fork will help you in implementing the already existing reliable open source code for your cryptocurrency. In order to create a unique coin for this purpose, you can choose to use the code of your closest coin that has the necessary features you need and then enables the changes later to it. Advantages of following this approach are: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launch your own version of cryptocurrency with a secure blockchain that will protect your data from external fraudulent attacks/errors such as double spending.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unrestricted access to a number of features such as built-in decentralized exchanges that will allow people to trade their cryptocurrencies for digital assets.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since one doesn’t have to go through the long process of coding and developing, it will save a lot of time on your end. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After you figure out the above steps, here are a few more tips that will assist you in moving further. </span></p>
<p><b>Involve the local community:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s utter negligence, to expect people to accept your crypto coins immediately when you launch it. Focus on finding the unique selling proposition of your coin and how it will match with the community’s needs and address the reasons on why your new currency must exist and then proceed to your coding part.</span></p>
<p><b>The development part should be precise:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned earlier, you can use either of the aforementioned methods to launch your cryptocurrency.  But given an option, you can always self-code. However, you must be aware of the choice of your language in advance before heading to the development part. </span></p>
<p><b>Create a Prototype first:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of explaining a concept to your target consumers, you can create a prototype for consumer’s approval. This will help the consumers and the community members to have a better clarity on your concept.</span></p>
<p><b>Get miners:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as the development part of your coin is done, you will require miners. Instead of overselling your cryptocurrency to them, you can build their trust, express the vision and share the intentions of your coin. In this way, your miners will have an honest understanding of your idea which will make them stay as loyal customers for a longer time.</span></p>
<p><b>Step into the shoes of a hacker:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put yourself in a hacker’s place and try to search for loopholes and downfalls of your cryptocurrency. This will help you in strengthening your security of the framework. </span></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the cryptocurrency fever rises every year, several entrepreneurs and industry leaders have started releasing their own cryptocurrency. However, it should be known that most of these coins get discarded or crashed due to numerous reasons. But in reality, most of the big names in the cryptocurrency market are all heading for sustainability rather immediate profitability.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The popularity of cryptocurrency has reached greater heights over the past few years and it has become a topic of discussion even outside tech circles. In certain places, the likes of Bitcoin, Ethereum and LiteCoin have been used very frequently similar to the fiat currencies such as the Dollar and Euro. All the transactions are made through a cryptocurrency wallet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though the value of fiat currency will always be on top, there is a general perception that cryptocurrencies will eventually change the banking system and even replace them entirely one day. Despite the fluctuations in the value of cryptocurrencies and continuous price drops, digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are still thriving and there is plenty of room for new ventures to take a piece of it.  If you are planning on creating your own </span><a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/cryptocurrency-exchange-software"><b><i>Cryptocurrency exchange script</i></b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this article will help you in understanding the nuances of crafting a cryptocurrency exchange and the costs behind it.</span></p>
<p><b>Types of cryptocurrency exchanges</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we proceed to the development side, let’s look at the types of crypto-exchanges that exist in the market today. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are direct trade platforms that provide tools for brokering immediate deals between users. These exchange platforms do not involve any pre-established market price, instead, the traders will be setting their own exchange rates</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there are Brokerage platforms which can be used by any person to buy the currencies/tokens set by a cryptocurrency agent.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from these, Cryptocurrency fund platforms which are investment pools with professional management where one can buy and hold virtual assets.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Now that we have understood the type of exchanges, let’s look at what are the tools required to the creation of the exchange platform.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will require order lists- A table which represents all the transactions made by the market players</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charts that display digital currencies volatility index. They can be used to compare different trading pairs before making transactions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A complete detailed history of the most profitable transactions for qualitative analysis. This will be beneficial for determining bidder’s demands as well as more accurate forecasting, which is the basis of any trade. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Determine the time and budget restraints</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the exchange software is highly complex, its development and debugging can take a whole year or even more. Keep in mind about the time involved, the professionalism of your developer team heavily influences the amount of required time. Remember that while developing software, employees must receive wages that depend on the complexity of tasks involved. To create such a program, you will need a team of experienced developers as a single IT specialist will not be enough for such a task. It is clear that a qualified team requires investing a lot of resources. Therefore, be patient, because when it comes to cryptocurrencies, you need a trading platform that has been crafted to perfection.</span></p>
<p><b>Process methodology</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a user account system is imperial for your cryptocurrency exchange development. In a typical user profile, the customer has to be identified, and there must be an option for depositing and withdrawing currency. With the help of the platform, investors will be able to manipulate their market positions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among other things, you will definitely require an aggregator. Using an aggregator, users can create their own coins or tokens and put it on the list of assets immediately. The aggregator usually processes a large amount of information every second and that’s one of the reasons it’s pretty expensive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Trading kernel is a must, without the trading kernel, the currency exchange will not function.  The purpose of the trading kernel is to create the order book, carry out the transaction and calculate the balance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not the least the currency exchange platform must have a user-friendly intuitive interface. This design should invoke attention from the customers. The interface should adapt itself or smartphones, tablets and other devices. Custom-made mobile applications will make your exchange even more attractive and user-friendly.</span></p>
<p><b>An interface should provide the user with the following features:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quick registration process</span></b></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deposition and withdrawal of cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Complete access to trading accounts</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Booking history &amp; review of past transactions</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statistical monitoring</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">24/7 customer support</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vibrant infographics and charts</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Wallet creation</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a wallet is absolutely vital for the </span><a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/cryptocurrency-exchange-software"><b><i>cryptocurrency exchange software development</i></b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The client will use it to store the cryptocurrency and it will also ensure complete security of the users’ wallets. To minimize all risks, wallets should be divided into two groups- Hot wallets and cold wallets</span></p>
<p><b>Hot wallets</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hot wallets will allow users to export currency to an external wallet. The money that has been withdrawn does not require the approval of the exchange administrator. Cold wallets contain the remaining coins or tokens that have not been used. No one will be able to access a cold wallet if a hot wallet has been hacked, as the cold one is completely disconnected from the network. Therefore, users prefer to keep the main part of their assets in the cold wallet. </span></p>
<p><b>Team Required to develop the Cryptocurrency Exchange Basic Web Portal and Mobile App</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One Android developer at $60/hour to develop an Android application</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One back-end developer charging at $60/hour to develop a backend service</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One IOS developer at $65/hour to develop an iOS application</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A single front-end developer to develop both front end and back end websites at $50/hour</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One graphic designer to design the website and the app at $35/hour</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two QA engineers for testing at $30/hour</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One project lead to handle the team for an entire year at $60/hour</span></li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The technology of today’s world is progressing at a very frantic pace. New innovations and technological developments have made it possible to develop new synergies in an existing framework. Blockchain technology which has bamboozled peopled across with its effectiveness made it possible to dream about a decentralized unit. Similarly, Internet of Things (IoT) has also been picking up a rapid pace. With the help of IoT, independent devices will be able to connect themselves to the internet. This synchronization will help in the development of intelligent devices which will be able to carry out work independent of human interference. But what happens if IoT is integrated with Blockchain? It does sound straight out of a science fiction novel. However, IoT and Blockchain seem to be a natural fit. In this article, we will discuss how IoT will influence the future of Blockchain technology and why nobody has yet succeeded at running IoT on the blockchain framework. </span></p>
<h4><b>IoT- A significant jump towards the future</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IoT is based on the concept where wirelessly connected sensors are embedded in almost any commonly used devices such as refrigerators, auto-parts, washing machines and even dog collars. This means everything can be tracked, it’s inventory managed and can be made accessible through a continuous stream of signals. This constant flow of interacting devices will help the businesses to move away from the product-oriented theme to the service-oriented theme. But it also brings us to one important issue to address. According to estimates, there will be around 10 million inter-connected devices and objects in the next four years. This will create a huge amount of tracking to identify those things and also verify who owns them, authenticate their interaction with other things in the interloop. </span></p>
<h4><b>How will IoT influence the landscape of Blockchain technology in the future?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many reputed organizations such as IBM have already started testing and experimenting with the applicability and future potential uses for the <a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blockchain-iot-development">blockchain network and the Internet of Things (IoT)</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For integrating the blockchain network with the IoT, developers must ensure that they treat every individual device as a unique user of the blockchain. Therefore, every vital piece of information that gets transmitted from the IoT device is processed by the Blockchain network as a transaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory this system does sound feasible, however, this is only possible if the size and the transmission of the messages are limited. Commercial deployment of blockchain based businesses will take some time as the blockchain based IoT network has to be upgraded significantly in order to serve many users.</span></p>
<h4><b>Why is it still a longshot solution?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the main problems blockchain network is facing these days is the scalability factor. To increase the scalability, optimizing the chain will help a bit but for mainstream market applications one must boost up the transaction processing speed which will affect other applications connected to the chain as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At present, only the Ethereum network, has more flexibility than other networks such as bitcoin, which can process only six transactions per second. To make a jump from six transactions per second to hundreds of thousands of transactions per second is definitely unrealistic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to handle this, an unprecedented scalability solution must be implemented. Plasma, an Ethereum scaling solution, could become a practical solution to the severe scalability issues of blockchain networks. It uses multiple blockchain networks that are interconnected with each other, and several aspects of transactions are kept confidential through the usage of ZK-SNARKs cryptographic system. This reduces the size of transactions and ultimately, increases the capacity of the blockchain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> However, even with side chains and second-layer solutions like Plasma or Lightning Network, it is still out of the question for a blockchain to handle hundreds of thousands of data points per second. IBM  is currently focused on developing centralized blockchain networks. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the implementation of permission blockchain networks, there is a definite trade-off between security and flexibility. Nevertheless, this will assist in the successful implementation of blockchain technology with IoT in the near future.</span></p>
<h4><b>Conclusion</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, permission blockchain networks are the only realistic solution in terms of scalability and there are a few organizations which specialize in designing permissioned Blockchain networks. Blockchain App factory is one of the few reputed organizations apart from IBM which has successfully created permission private blockchain networks for numerous clients. The conglomeration of IoT and Blockchain can do wonders for the business.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past few months, we have been hearing the words Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin Wallets, Cryptocurrency Wallets etc. In this blog, we would like to give you an overview of the Cryptocurrency Wallets Development.</span></p>
<p><b>What is Cryptocurrency Wallet Development?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cryptocurrency wallet is a secure digital wallet used to store, send and receive digital cryptocurrencies like BitCoins, ERC20 etc. These cryptocurrencies have their own wallets, however, some companies use a third party wallet. In order to use cryptocurrency, you need to have <a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/cryptocurrency-wallet-development">developed new cryptocurrency wallet</a>.</span></p>
<p><b>How does Cryptocurrency Wallet Work?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cryptocurrency is not stored in wallet per say. Instead, it is a private key which is secure digital code that is only known to you. In addition to this, there is a public digital code which is connected to a certain amount of currency. The crypto-wallet stores this public as well as private key allowing the user to send and receive coins with the addition of acting as a ledger for the money sent and received.</span></p>
<p><b>Which is the best Cryptocurrency Wallet?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cryptocurrency wallets depend on the coin you are going to use. We at Blockchain App Factory suggest you use the official/officially endorsed wallet of the given coin. For example, use the Bitcoin Core Wallet for the Bitcoin, Litecoin Core for Litecoin and MyEtherWallet for Ethereum Coins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are wallets like HolyTransaction and Coinomi which can be used universal or multi-coin wallets which can store many cryptocurrencies, however, they cannot store all the currencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some custodial wallets where the private keys are not controlled by the user, however, users are advised against keeping their funds in exchanges which act as double to custodial wallets. There are useful offline hardware wallets like TREZOR and Nano S which are good long-term wallets allowing you to store various cryptocurrencies.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/cryptocurrency-wallet-development"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-209" src="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/wallet-developement-dummy.png" alt="cryptocurrency wallet app development " width="2903" height="1698" srcset="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/wallet-developement-dummy.png 2903w, https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/wallet-developement-dummy-300x175.png 300w, https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/wallet-developement-dummy-768x449.png 768w, https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/wallet-developement-dummy-1024x599.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2903px) 100vw, 2903px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>If you are new to Cryptocurrency, Blockchainappfactory suggests the following </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Download the official or officially endorsed wallet from their official website</li>
<li>Sign Up for Custodial Wallets</li>
<li>Purchase hardware wallets.</li>
<li>Use a universal software as mentioned above.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>What are common features of Multi-Cryptocurrency Wallets?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multi-cryptocurrency wallets have these common features  :</span></p>
<ol class="mar_right">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2- Factor Authentication</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most Used Address accessible to all user address</span></li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchains have been ruling the technological world for a while now. With companies investing lump sum in opportunities to secure data, blockchain technology is here to change the ideology of Cybersecurity. Cybersecurity has been an avenue of concern for ages. With the advent of blockchain technology, businesses can breathe a sigh of relief. Some of the advances that this technology can bring are mind-boggling. </span></p>
<p><b>Digital Authentication:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humans will no longer be needed to authenticate information. With blockchain technology, businesses will be able to authenticate users and devices. The problem arises when companies allow employees or customers to set their own passwords that becomes an encouraging component for theft. Blockchain technology resolves single point of attack and offers strong authentication.</span></p>
<p><b>Uncollapsible chain :</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blockchain is a huge network that stores data and is extremely secure. Since data is stored in blocks it is highly impossible to tamper with it since the blocks recognise attacks and eliminate the affected block deeming it unrecognisable.  </span></p>
<p><b>Transparency and Traceability:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of technology has a different approach toward traceability. It is no doubt that the transactions are accessible to the entire world yet every transaction is traceable. Irrespective of its gigantic network system, with the blockchain technology one can trace back to any transaction for any period of time. </span></p>
<p><b>Prevents Data Manipulation:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any digital data can be breached to create a different result which might end up being harmful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain Technology prevents data manipulation with its high-end cryptographic data structures. </span></p>
<p><b>No trust issues:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain technology uses cryptographic language and security is not dependent on passwords. Since it avoids human activity to authenticate, there are no passwords to be trusted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the safest and secure mode of storage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these exclusive <a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blockchain-development-company">features of blockchain technology</a> comes to the good news &#8211; Since blockchain technology uses encryption methods it is believed that it might take seven billion years for a hacker to get into the network using a brute-force attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has been a boon to many individuals and businesses alike. Blockchain technology has created trust and fulfilment in the hearts of millions. No matter what the future holds, Blockchains are here to stay. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The era of Initial Coin Offerings(ICO) is on an upward trend with media channels talking about the cryptocurrency on a daily basis. The end of 2017 closed with three ICOs per day. However, many of the ICOs ended up failing to reach their soft cap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of marketing an ICO, the budget for being successful along with the initial investments. It is recommended to create a prototype and gaining approval from the communities and advisors before scaling up to succeed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The article contains optimal <a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/ico-marketing-services">ICO marketing</a> strategy you can use to market their ICOs :</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><b>ICO Listings</b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The preferred strategy is to list your ICO on Con schedule, getting ratings from rating service. This will help you plug the leaks on the ICOs. This has to follow by pushing Free listings for placing the ICO. ICO Ratings appear and disappear every day starting their ratings from the top lists resulting in you gaining more traffic.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><b>Paid Advertising</b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should gain traction in traditional ad networks like Facebook, Twitter, and Google. This must be followed by moving into specialized crypto networks before few days of  ICO and sale. The ad manager operating this must have the knowledge of the craft he/she is working with. It is recommended to find an agent who specializes in ICO marketing like Blockchain App Factory.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><b>Event &amp; Shows</b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main focus of the activity is finding the place to find and get the message across to your investors face to face for getting your initial capital. The crowded capital might follow you if you raise the initial capital with big league investors. The communication for the events or shows must begin early while building online relationships by sending them relevant information.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><b>Media &amp; PR Outreach</b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the product is ready with product descriptions along with your website with high-quality content, it is time for you to reach out to the media. A good content along with press release could make your ICOs go viral. </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><b>Bounty &amp; Airdrop</b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main part of the budget should be driven towards Bounty &amp; Airdrop campaign. The social media marketing must focus via Social Media Marketing or on websites like Reddit and BitcoinTalk.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><b>Native Ads</b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are constrained by the budget or have a great product to tell the world, native ads are the way to do it. This is part of the <a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/ico-marketing-services">ico marketing agencies</a> offerings who can customize as per your requirement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We at Blockchain App Factory will guide you with our team of specialized social media managers &amp; market professionals, expert content writers and seasoned developers to value your investments.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, March 8 has been recognized as International Women’s Day. On this day, women around the world irrespective of nationality, ethnicity or cultural differences come around to support each other and take care of their peers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women have changed the face of the workforce and entered in every aspect of the field. We, at Blockchain App Factory, have celebrated International Women’s Day with much pomp and joy. All the women came around to enjoy this day to the full extent. </span></p>
<p><b>Events in place</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To enjoy this joyous day, our women from Blockchain App Factory came around to enjoy various events set by our Human Resource team. Team events made sure that everyone participated and get to know each other’s strength and weaknesses. Every woman at our Blockchain App Factory had the best of time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An event named PASS OF GEMS were played to test out the how two women from the completely different team were able to play a game. The objective of the game is to pass on gems from one bottle into next without taking out the top one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So with constant teamwork and extreme fun of passing the gems although messing up a few in the process, our women were able to send it down to next bottle for 3 minutes without hassles. </span></p>
<p><b>Finally…</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And a plethora of events made this international women’s day an occasion to remember. Women’s day is not about enjoying the power of womanhood but taking a knee in the ground and holding our sisters and peers around us and getting out of the shackles and boundaries that have set us back. Take your feminism and work hard for equality in every facet of work and life. Womanhood is to be celebrated and to be proud of our fight in this world. This women’s day at Blockchain App Factory has honored our Women and made us happy for all the days to come.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blockchain is a robust technology which bears resemblance to the internet of the 90s era, however, it is designed to impact the way we live, we function and the way we interact. Originally created for the regulation of digital currency such as Bitcoin, it is basically a digital, decentralized public ledger for all the cryptocurrencies. One of the unique aspects of Blockchain technology is that digital information can be distributed not copied, creating a backbone for a new type of internet. Presently, this technology is being primarily used to verify transactions, within the digital currencies; nevertheless, the tech community is finding other potential uses for the technology. </span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blockchain-development-company"><b>How will Blockchain technology impact other industries?</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The popularity of virtual currencies is proving Blockchain’s usefulness in finance, but industry experts believe that blockchain can transform more industries. Since blockchain operates through a decentralized platform which requires no supervision, it is extremely resistant to fraud. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly a lot of start-ups are deploying Blockchain in an effort to strive for greater transparency and accuracy across the <strong>digital information ecosystem</strong>. By switching to the blockchain, they are boosting awareness in other sectors ranging from infrastructure to public policy. Following are the different industrial segments which are harnessing the power of global blockchain:-</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><b>Banking Sector</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since blockchain uses a secure and tamper-proof ledger, it could serve the same function by injecting enhanced accuracy and information sharing into the financial services ecosystem. It can be modified to provide financial services to billions of people around the world, including to those who are living in third world countries who don’t have any access to a traditional form of banking. The UK based Barclays and Swiss bank UBS have already started experimenting with blockchain technology to accelerate the back office tasks, which could cut up to $20 billion in middleman costs. Banks are currently exploring and investing in <strong>Blockchain start-ups such as R3 CEV, who are currently working along with banks, financial regulators and technological partners in developing Corda,</strong> an exclusive blockchain platform designed specifically for the new operating system for financial markets.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blockchain-development-company"><img class="alignnone wp-image-136 size-full" src="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bank-1.jpg" alt="Industries that benefit from Blockchain technology of Banking " width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bank-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bank-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bank-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><b>Real Estate</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often the real estate segment gets a bad rep due to the lack of transparency during and after the transactions, large amounts of paperwork, fraud and unwarranted human errors in public records as well. But Blockchain offers a distinct method to <strong>reduce the need for paper-based record keeping and speed up the transactions,</strong> thus assisting the stakeholders to improve the efficiency and help in reduction of transaction costs at all sides of the transaction. <a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blockchain-development-company">Real estate Blockchain applications</a> can help in recording, tracking, transferring of land titles, property deeds and even ensure that all the documents are accurate and verifiable. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blockchain-development-company"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137" src="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Real-estate.jpg" alt="Industries that benefit from Blockchain technology Real estate " width="870" height="415" srcset="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Real-estate.jpg 870w, https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Real-estate-300x143.jpg 300w, https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Real-estate-768x366.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><b>Supply chain and Logistics</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using this technology financial transaction can be well-documented in a decentralized record and monitored separately. One of the advantages of using Blockchain is that it provides secure remote and transparent monitoring of transactions. This will <strong>reduce the potential time delays and removes human errors</strong>. Aside from that, it can also be used to monitor costs, labour and even emission control at every point of the supply chain. Blockchain’s unique<strong> distributed ledger system</strong> can be used to verify the authenticity or the trade status of products by thoroughly tracking them from their origin. Provenance, Hijro, SKUChain and Blockverify are some of the reputed blockchain companies currently working in this segment.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blockchain-development-company"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-138" src="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Logistics.jpg" alt="" width="920" height="500" srcset="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Logistics.jpg 920w, https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Logistics-300x163.jpg 300w, https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Logistics-768x417.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 920px) 100vw, 920px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><b>Education segment</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are all aware of the strict regulations that the present day <strong>educational institutions follow in order to be universally accepted and verified.</strong> Despite the progress made in recent year’s verification of academic credentials still remains largely a manual process. Instilling blockchain solutions in the academic process could help in streamlining the verification process, thereby reducing fraudulent claims of un-earned educational credits. Recently Sony Global Education has developed a new educational platform in an exclusive partnership with IBM that uses <strong>Blockchain to secure the student records.</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blockchain-development-company"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-139" src="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Education.jpg" alt="Industries that benefit from Blockchain technology Education" width="980" height="551" srcset="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Education.jpg 980w, https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Education-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Education-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></a></p>
<h2><b>Future application in different segments</b></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><b>Healthcare Segment</b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthcare institutions are presently suffering from an inability to share data securely across platforms. Blockchain technology could allow hospitals, payers, patients and other parties in the healthcare value chain to share access to their networks compromising on the data security and integrity. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><b>Entertainment and Music Industry</b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entrepreneurs from the <strong>entertainment industry are switching to Blockchain</strong> to make content sharing fairer and easier for contracts who are using smart contracts. Thus the revenue from purchases of creative work can be distributed automatically according to the pre-licensing agreements.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><b>Stock Trading</b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies have been working for years to ease the process of selling, buying and trading stocks. But now they are focusing on the Blockchain based start-ups who are looking to automate and secure the entire process more efficiently than any other past solutions. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><b>Forecasting and Market Research</b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since more and more industries are adopting Blockchain technology in a more holistic way, Companies which are more specialized in areas of <strong>research, analysis and consulting</strong> are also being rattled up by this technology. The foundations of Blockchain are unshakable and are apt for accurate transaction record supporting the data analysis. Forecasting and predicting operations will have a strong foundation for using machine-generated algorithms to inculcate targeted predictions and insights. </span></p>
<h4><b>Final Thoughts</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is an increased interest from entrepreneurs in <strong>Blockchain technology</strong> over the recent years due to its well defined, transparent, highly secured work process. To survive in this tightly knit competitive environment one must adapt to the latest technological advancements and right now Blockchain technology is definitely pointing to the future. we are one of the best technology company to <a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com"><strong>develop decentralized applications development</strong></a> using blockchain technology.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ICOs are the hot topic of the day and deservedly so, because of their potential to be agile capital-raisers for coin creation at almost one fourth the cost of an IPO. ICOs can be looked upon as an alternative method of crowdfunding that has evolved outside of the traditional system of finance. An ICO progresses over a period of a week or more and allows the purchase of newly issued token in exchange for the pre-established cryptocurrency. The token will have a designated price which does not change during the period of ICO making the token supply static. Other options are to have a static supply with dynamic funding (More the funds, higher the token price) or have a dynamic token supply that will be determined by the number of funds received (Static price for token, new token created for every paid currency unit within a limited time frame). ICOs are one of the easiest and quickest ways for companies to fund their projects and for users to invest in projects.</p>
<h2 style="font-family: verdana;">The Process of Building a Coin</h2>
<p>From a developer’s perspective, the process of creating a coin and a landing page using the <strong>Ethereum platform</strong> are as follows.</p>
<h4 style="font-family: verdana;">Specifications</h4>
<p>Agreeing upon a set of specifications will help in laying down the rules and avoid making updates which might reduce the trust from the community. Basic parameters like start date, end date, minimum and maximum caps and the currency for exchange are discussed and confirmed during this phase.</p>
<h4 style="font-family: verdana;">Smart Contract Implementation, Testing &amp; Deployment</h4>
<p>All lines of codes are tested thoroughly and tests are conducted for all possible scenarios. Static code analysis, audit and code review helps to detect inconsistent behaviour and fix them.</p>
<h4 style="font-family: verdana;">Tools of the Trade</h4>
<p>To develop a basic<strong> <a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/smart-contract-development?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content">Ethereum Smart Contract</a></strong> to represent a coin with a simple Initial Coin Offering can be accomplished with Solidity as the programming language, OpenZeppelin Solidity contracts as the foundation for the Smart contract, Truffle Framework as the testing and building tool, TestRPC for Ethereum blockchain node simulation, JavaScript for programming the unit tests and MyEtherWallet for testing and deployment of the contract on Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<h4 style="font-family: verdana;">Implementation</h4>
<p>An instance of the contract is tested to check its properties by accessing the fields and calling functions to implement missing parts.</p>
<h4 style="font-family: verdana;">Deployment</h4>
<p>After putting the contract through a set of unit tests, it is compiled using Truffle and deployed to test Ethereum blockchain using MyEtherWallet</p>
<h4 style="font-family: verdana;">Manual Testing</h4>
<p>The code is put through extensive unit tests before going live and also tested against a working blockchain.</p>
<h4 style="font-family: verdana;">ICO Status Page</h4>
<p>The status page is a crucial part of the ICO. An ideal status page effectively informs token buyers about the basic ICO parameters like start and end dates, minimum and maximum cap, rates, bonuses etc.</p>
<h4 style="font-family: verdana;">Conclusion</h4>
<p>So far we have covered the introduction to Ethereum Smart Contracts, ICOs, the importance of clear specifications, development of smart contracts, manual and automatic testing. There’s more to a successful ICO, such as an effective whitepaper, technical execution, and <strong><a title="ICO Development Company" href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/ico-development">ico marketing strategies</a></strong>.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blockchain technology is the decentralized or distributed ledger technology used mainly to trade without any loses or the middlemen. The blockchain technology in the financial sector uses cryptocurrencies in order to perform a glitch-free transaction across channels and with any number of traders. There are many different cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Bitcoin, Ripple et cetera that traders use and there are 700 more virtual currencies being traded around the world currently. As per actual practice, the following industries can employ blockchain technology to make the most out of this cryptocurrency surge. </span></p>
<p><b>Banking Sector</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the use of blockchain technology in the banking and payment sector, billions of people can get easy access to the financial opportunities. Even those who don’t currently have access to the traditional payment options can utilize blockchain technology to trade. Across seas and nations, blockchain technology will help traders make business at extremely very low fees. Since the transactional data backed up with blockchain technology is highly encrypted and tough to track, this is one such secure way to trading. </span></p>
<p><b>Supply Chain Management</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transactions using blockchain technology can be entered as a non-removable/permanent decentralized record. Can be monitored securely and transparently. This can keep us off time lag and human errors. Predominantly used to observe costs, labour, and waste management and emissions at every step of the <a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/supply-chain-management-development">supply chain</a>. This will greatly help to understand and control the actual environmental impact caused by the products. Can also be used to verify the originality of products by tracking them from the inception day. </span></p>
<p><b>Storage on Cloud</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data stored on a centralized server is naturally prone to hacking, loss of data or human error and interventions. Blockchain technology will allow cloud storage to be more secure and essentially fight against data breaches. </span></p>
<p><b>Charity</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inefficiency and corruption are the common complaints within the charity space. Which basically prevents money from getting to the appropriate person. Using blockchain technology will help us track whether or not the donations are going to the right individual/association. Bitcoin-based charities like the BitGive Foundation uses blockchain’s secure and decentralized ledger providing donors with the information that the intended party has received the funds.</span></p>
<p><b>Election</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most important areas of society that the blockchain will do actual good to is electoral reforms. The recent past 2016 US election is not the only time parties were cited for controversial election results. <a href="https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/blockchain-development-company">Blockchain technology</a> can be used in future for voter registration and identity verification. Also for electronic vote counting to assure that only valid votes are tallied. Creating a publicly-viewable ledger of legitimately obtained votes would be a huge step toward making elections more democratic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further if you have any other verticals that you think blockchain technology can disrupt or leave a mark, mention them in the comment.
